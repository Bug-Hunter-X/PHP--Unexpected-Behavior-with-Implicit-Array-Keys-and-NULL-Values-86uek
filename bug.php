In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  Consider this scenario:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["nonexistentKey"] = "some value";
$myArray["anotherNonexistentKey"] = "another value";

foreach ($myArray as $key => $value) {
    echo "Key: " . $key . ", Value: " . $value . "\n";
}
```

While this code appears innocuous, it might lead to unexpected results.  If the `nonexistentKey` or similar keys are later used in a conditional check or array access without prior existence confirmation (isset()), it can result in issues.  It's not a syntax error, rather it's a logical error stemming from implicit key creation.

Another problematic area is handling of NULL values in arrays without proper checks.  If one assumes all array values are non-NULL, this assumption can lead to unexpected application behavior or crashes.

The lack of strict typing also plays a part in this. PHP's loose typing allows for different types of values in a same array, which makes debugging such problems a bit challenging.
